## About
This repository provides a model for 
"[Neural Mulliken Analysis: Molecular Graphs from Density Matrices for QSPR on Raw Quantum-Chemical Data](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5c00425)"
paper (also available as a 
[preprint](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-k2k3l-v3) which doesn't cover 
the model provided here). 

A notebook with minimal inference example is also available (see 
[rhnet2.ipynb](https://github.com/Shorku/SolubilityChallenge2019/blob/main/rhnet2.ipynb)).
For general RhNet2 model implementation see the 
[corresponding repository](https://github.com/Shorku/rhnet2).

## Model
The model provided here was trained and tested using test sets from
the Second Solubility Challenge (SC-2, 
[link](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00345),
[link](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00701)). 
Evaluation results are available in 
[RhNet2SC2_results.csv](https://github.com/Shorku/SolubilityChallenge2019/blob/main/RhNet2SC2_results.csv).
